# Music Player Instructions

This project was made by me in Python, it was a college project, as you can see in the files, this was made in Spanish. There you can see a txt file named "Guia de Usuario", which is a better explanation about what is this project for.

If you want to run the project and try it yourself, you can do so by downloading the files, opening Python and running it manually by running the file .py named "REPRODUCTOR" 
(you may need to install the library "pygame" for it to work, you can do so by going to your terminal and writing the next command "pip install pygame")
